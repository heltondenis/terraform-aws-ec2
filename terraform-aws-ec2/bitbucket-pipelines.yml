# Template Terraform to deploy to Cloud Infrastructure

# This template allows you to deploy your infrastructure using Terraform to supported cloud providers.
# The workflow allows running tests, security scans on feature branches (as well as master).
# After merging code to master the infrastructure will be deployed to cloud according to the given terraform template.

# Prerequisites: credentials according to used cloud provider.
# For advanced cases, please, follow terraform docs https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html.
